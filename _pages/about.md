![Rock Glacier](files/20170709_101651.jpg)

I am a PhD student studying under [Professor Brad Lipovsky](https://bradlipovsky.github.io/) in the Environmental Geophysics and Computation research group in the [Department of Earth and Space Sciences](https://www.ess.washington.edu/) at the University of Washington.

My research interests include
  - Glacial seismology and its applications in observing glacier sliding
  - Using distributed acoustic sensing to better understand subglacial processes and basal-ice interactions
  - Observing and modeling glacier geophysical and hydrological processes
